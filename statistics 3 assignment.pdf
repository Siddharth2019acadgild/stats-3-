Question 1

We are given
u=100
s=15
n=36
we take null hypothesis testing
we take a=.05
Z-test
z0=(X(bar)-u)/(s/vn)
  = (108-100)
    /(15/6)
  =16/5=3.2

The critical values for 0.05 are (+1.96,-1.96)
since z0>1.96
we reject null hypothesis, therefore raw starch will have positive effect.               

Question 2

let P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first
state, P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, p1 = the proportion of
Republican voters in the sample from the first state, and p2 = the proportion of Republican voters
in the sample from the second state.

100 samples are chosen from each state
n1,n2=100

 n1P1 = 100 * 0.52 = 52, n1(1 - P1) = 100 * 0.48 = 48, n2P2
= 100 * 0.47 = 47, and n2(1 - P2) = 100 * 0.53 = 53
 
 mean difference = 0.52 - 0.47= 0.05 
sd = sqrt{ [ P1(1 - P1) / n1 ] + [ P2(1 - P2) / n2 ] } 
   =sqrt (0.002496 + 0.002491) = 0.0706
 
zp1 - p2 = (x - µp1 - p2) / sd = = (0 - 0.05)/0.0706 = -0.7082

The associated p value is 0.24

Question 3

z= (1100-1026)/209
 = .354.  (means  .354 std devs above the mean)
